## ðŸ“‚ Typical Project Layout

Let's take a look at a typical project layout:

-   `project_root/`
    -   `config.json`: This is where you'll keep your app's secrets and settings, like database passwords or API keys.
    -   `index.js`: The starting pistol for your web application! This file kicks off the CandyPack framework.
    -   `package.json`: Contains project metadata and npm scripts for development. Automatically generated when creating a new website.
    -   `public/`: All files placed in this folder are directly accessible from the outside. This is the perfect place for your images, stylesheets, and client-side JavaScript.
    -   `route/`: This folder holds all your route definitions. The filename of the route file corresponds to the subdomain it serves.
        -   `www.js`: Used for routes on your main domain (e.g., `www.example.com` or `example.com`).
        -   `api.js`: Used for routes on a subdomain (e.g., `api.example.com`). When a request comes in for `api.example.com`, this is the route file that gets used. You can create files for any subdomain!
    -   `controller/`: This is where the magic happens! Controllers contain the main logic for your application.
        -   `page/`: We suggest putting controllers that show HTML pages in here.
        -   `api/`: If you're building an API, it's a great idea to keep those controllers separate in their own folder.
    -   `view/`: For all your HTML template files. This is what your users will see.

### Development Commands

Your `package.json` includes helpful npm scripts for development:

```bash
# Start development server (default port 1071)
npm start

# Start development server on custom port
npm start 8080
```

You can also use CandyPack commands directly:

```bash
# Development server (local testing only)
candypack framework run [port]
```

**Note**: For production websites with DNS and SSL, use `candy web create` to register with CandyPack server.

Following this structure helps keep your code's responsibilities separate. Your routing logic lives in one place, your app logic in another, and your presentation files in a third. It's a recipe for success!
