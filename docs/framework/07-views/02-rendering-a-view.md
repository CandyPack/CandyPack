## ðŸŽ¨ Rendering a View

To bring a view to life, you'll use the `Candy.View.render()` method.

`Candy.View.render('path/to/your-view', { some: 'data' })`

*   `'path/to/your-view'`: The path to your view file inside the `view/` folder. No need to add the file extension!
*   `{ some: 'data' }`: An optional object of data you want to pass to your view. This is how you send dynamic information from your controller to your HTML.

#### Let's Build a Profile Page!

Imagine you have a user profile page at `view/user/profile.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>User Profile</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- The 'name' and 'email' variables come from our controller -->
    <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
    <p>We've got your email down as {{ email }}.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Now, let's make a controller to render it:

```javascript
module.exports = function (Candy) {
  // Let's create some data to send to the view
  const userData = {
    name: 'Captain Coder',
    email: 'captain@coder.com'
  };

  // Now, render the view and pass the data along
  return Candy.View.render('user/profile', userData);
}
```

When this code runs, CandyPack's simple template engine will find the `{{ name }}` and `{{ email }}` placeholders in your HTML and replace them with the data from your controller. Voila! A beautiful, dynamic page.
