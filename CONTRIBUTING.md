# Contributing to CandyPack

First off, thank you for considering contributing to CandyPack! It's people like you that make CandyPack such a great tool.

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [CandyPack Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to security@candypack.dev.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into CandyPack itself.

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please check the [issues list](https://github.com/CandyPack/CandyPack/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has, please add a comment to the existing issue instead of creating a new one.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue with the "feature request" label. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature, why it's needed, and how it should work.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to CandyPack? You can start by looking through `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

*   [Good first issues](https://github.com/CandyPack/CandyPack/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
*   [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/CandyPack/CandyPack/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.

### Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests from the community. Here's a quick guide:

1.  **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
6.  Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

*   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
*   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
*   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
*   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript must adhere to the style defined in the `.prettierrc` file.
