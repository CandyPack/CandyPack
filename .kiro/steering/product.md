# CandyPack Product Overview

CandyPack is a next-generation server and framework toolkit that combines hosting infrastructure with a web development framework. It's designed as a lightweight, zero-config solution for building and deploying modern web applications.

## Core Components

- **Server**: Full-featured hosting platform with DNS, SSL, mail server (IMAP/SMTP), and multi-domain support
- **Framework**: Web application framework with routing, authentication, CSRF protection, and internationalization
- **CLI**: Command-line interface for server management and deployment
- **Watchdog**: Process monitoring and management system

## Key Philosophy

- **Developer-first**: Zero-config approach, focus on code rather than infrastructure
- **Performance-oriented**: Lightweight and optimized for speed
- **Security-focused**: Built-in CSRF protection, SSL automation, secure defaults
- **Global-ready**: Multi-language support and internationalization built-in

The project follows AGPL-3.0 licensing and targets Node.js 18+ environments.
